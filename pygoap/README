pygoap v.3.3
requires python 3.x

PyGoap is a small library for designing AI in python.  The basic library is based off of a well-known idea of using
graph searches to to create believable behaviour in real-time.  Behavior is determined in real-time and is extremely
open ended and well suited for emergent behaviors.

PyGOAP agents can be programmed very simply with an easy to understand api.

If you are unfamiliar with GOAP, I invite you to do some research online, it may help you to understand this module.
