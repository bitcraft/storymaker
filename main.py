"""
excerpt from days of our lives:
Liz was married to Tony. Neither loved the other, and, indeed, Liz was in love
with Neil.  However, unknown to either Tony or Neil, Stephano, Tonyâ€™s father,
who wanted Liz to produce a grandson for him, threatened Liz that if she left
Tony, he would kill Neil. Liz told Neil that she did not love him, that she was
still in love with Tony, and that he should forget about her. Eventually, Neil
was convinced and he married Marie. Later, when Liz was finally free from Tony
(because Stephano had died), Neil was not free to marry her and their trouble
went on.
